% voronoiDiagram  Returns the Voronoi diagram
%    The Voronoi diagram of a discrete set of points X decomposes the space 
%    around each point X(i) into a region of influence R{i}. Locations within 
%    the region R{i} are closer to point i than any other point in X. The 
%    region of influence is called the Voronoi region. The collection of all 
%    the Voronoi regions is the Voronoi diagram.
%
%    [V, R] = voronoiDiagram(DT)  returns the vertices V and regions R of 
%    the Voronoi diagram of the points DT.X. The region R{i} is a cell array 
%    of indices into V that represents the Voronoi vertices bounding the 
%    region. V is a numv-by-ndim matrix representing the coordinates of the 
%    Voronoi vertices, where numv is the number of vertices and ndim is the 
%    dimension of the space where the points reside. R is a vector cell array 
%    of length(DR.X), representing the Voronoi cell associated with each 
%    point. Hence, the Voronoi region associated with the i'th point,
%    DT.X(i) is R{i}.
%
%    For 2-D, vertices in R{i} are listed in adjacent order, i.e. connecting 
%    them will generate a closed polygon (Voronoi diagram). For 3-D 
%    the vertices in R{i} are listed in ascending order. 
%
%    The Infinite Vertex
%    The Voronoi regions associated with points that lie on the convex hull
%    of DT.X are unbounded. Bounding edges of these regions radiate to
%    infinity. The vertex at infinity is represented by the first vertex in V.
%
%    Example: Compute the Voronoi Diagram of a set of points
%        X = [ 0.5    0
%              0      0.5
%             -0.5   -0.5
%             -0.2   -0.1
%             -0.1    0.1
%              0.1   -0.1
%              0.1    0.1 ]
%        dt = DelaunayTri(X)
%        [V,R] = voronoiDiagram(dt)
